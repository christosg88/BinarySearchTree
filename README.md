# BinarySearchTree
This project includes implementations of the most operations in a Balanced Binary Search Tree

The implemented operations include:
- Insertion of a node
- Deletion of a node
- Searching for a specific key in the tree
- Traversal of the tree
    - Inorder
    - Level oder
    - Post order
    - Pre order
- Test if the tree is height balanced
